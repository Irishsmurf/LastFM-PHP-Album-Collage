A Script that takes in < last.fm username> and collages their most played albums in a grid
Uses S3 to store the images in a persistant manner without filling up the local disk.

Tested using PHP 5.5 and requires PHP-GD library for building the images

Requires a config.inc.php file to include you AWS Access Keys in the form of:

$config['accessKey'] = '<AWS Access Key>';
$config['secretKey'] = '<SecretKey>';

It also requires Last.fm keys:

$config['api_key'] = '<LastFM Key>';
