A Script that takes in < last.fm username> and collages their most played albums in a grid
Uses S3 to store the images in a persistant manner without filling up the local disk.

Tested using PHP 5.5 and requires PHP-GD library for building the images

Requires AWS IAM Roles running on your instance.

Below is the sample JSON for your IAM Role:

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1402566164255",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectVersionAcl",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<Bucket Name/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<Bucket Name>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}


It also requires Last.fm keys:

$config['api_key'] = '<LastFM Key>'


If no config.inc.php file is found, it will use the following environment variables:

api_key,
bucket;
