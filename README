A Script that takes in < last.fm username> and collages their most played albums in a grid
Uses S3 to store the images in a persistant manner without filling up the local disk.

Tested using PHP 5.5 and requires PHP-GD library for building the images

Requires AWS IAM Roles running on your instance.

It also requires Last.fm keys:

$config['api_key'] = '<LastFM Key>'


If no config.inc.php file is found, it will use the following environment variables:

accessKey,
secretKey,
api_key,
bucket;
